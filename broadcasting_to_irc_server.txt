LambdaMOO/Hellcore: Broadcasting to an IRC server

On Wayfar, when a player is killed they get a death taunt in the style of the LORD or BBS door games.  When enough kills are accumulated the MOO connects to an IRC server, posts a kill update, and then disconnects.

The commands to interact with an IRC server are straightforward:

conn = open_network_connection(server, port);
set_connection_option(conn, "hold-input", 1);

Open the connection and tell the MOO not interpret anything on this connection as a game command.



notify(conn, "USER YOUR_USR_NAME 8 *  : your_comment");
botname = "Jerkturkey";
notify(conn, "NICK " + botname);

That sends the USER and NICK.  Now the IRC server will send a bunch of nonsense at you, then disconnect you if you don't answer the ping request in time.  So we wait for the first ping before we start sending messages:


while (line = read(conn))
      if (hurf = $su:explode(line))
        if ($su:uppercase(hurf[1]) == "PING")
          notify(conn, "PONG " + hurf[2]);
          break;
        endif
      endif
    endwhile

Note that we have to reply with information from the request.  Next up, join a channel:

notify(conn, "JOIN #wayfar1444");

Send whatever messages we've arranged, preferably a batch of messages:

for x in ($web.irc_queue)
     notify(conn, "PRIVMSG #wayfar1444 :"+x);
endfor

Tell the IRC server we're leaving and disconnect:

notify(conn, "QUIT");
boot_player(conn);
