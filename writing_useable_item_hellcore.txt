How to write a useable item in Hellcore/Wayfar

Requires basic knowledge of object creation - please reference the LambdaMOO programmer's guide.

Step 1: create the item from an appropriate parent.

Step 2: add a verb on the item for the player to kick off the action, it should look like this:

@verb #itemid:use this none none
1: if(this.location != player)
2: return player:tell("You have to be holding this to use it!");
3: else
4: player:queue_action($actions.use, {this, #-1}, 1, "use "+this:name());
5: endif

Step 3: Write two new verbs on the item to handle the use action:

do_use_start(OBJ who, OBJ on)
do_use_finish(OBJ who, OBJ on)

In our example we are just using the item, we aren't using it on anything.  This would need a more complex verb on the item in the form of:
@verb #itemid use this on any

And then you'd need to match the any against and item or person.
