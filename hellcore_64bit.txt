General Tips for compiling Hellcore on 64 bit CentOS and other systems

It is good practice to create a seperate user to run the moo.  You can name it moo, or your own name, or your mother's name.  You should add this user to the wheel group, so it has access to the sudo command.

Move the hellcore.tar.gz to the home directory of your user.  Extract it into a subfolder, called moo or something.  Run this command:  tar -xvzf hellcore1104.tar.gz

This will unzip the hellcore.  Change directory to the src directory.

Now, setup your 64 bit system to actually be able to compile this beast:

sudo yum install bison
sudo yum -y install glibc.i686
sudo yum install libstdc++.i686
sudo yum install screen

In the src directory run these commands:
make clean
make

If you get no "exited with error" message at the end, success, you have won and can now retire.

To start the moo:

screen ./restart hellcore 7777
CTRL+A+D
Now you can return to view the screen with screen -r.  If you need to emergency shutdown the MOO, you can resume the screen and press CTRL+C - this will immediately dump everything to hellcore.db.panic!  Handy!
